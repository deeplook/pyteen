Manage a collection of short Python code snippets, all tested & validated, easy to contribute to, and simple to reuse.

Background
----------

People like to collect things and developers are no exception.
They accumulate software artefacts and use them to create new ones which they
usually will happily pass on.

On a low level these are often snippets of code they found useful and feel
like they could be helpful for others, too, sometimes for their future self.
The pattern behind this process are often very informal, and you can find
online many more or less useful and more or less organized such collections.

This project aims to make this kind of exchange more valuable and productive
by adding only a tiny bit of organizational rigor.
The result should be a system that allows to collect, validate, test, search,
reuse and share such snippets with very little constraints placed on them.
